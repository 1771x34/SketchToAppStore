======================

Apple has made creating screenshots for iTunes Connect a huge pain in the ass with the new phone sizes. I created this to hopefully save everyone some time.

# How it works

*This is an early draft of this resource.* You should only need to make edits and adjustments on the first page (called Setup). The other pages will be automatically changed with the info you swap here.

Whenever you’re ready, do a File → Export.

# What the exports look like
This will generate 10 screenshots for each size, a set of images with the device and text, and a set that’s just the screenshot.

# How files are organized
Just choose a folder and the files will be exported like this. They are exported in *JPG* format because iTunes connect currently requires that.
